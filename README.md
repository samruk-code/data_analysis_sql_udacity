SQL for Data Analysis
I am interested in Data Analytics. Therefore, I was taken Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Program. 
Then I thought I needed to strengthen my knowledge of SQL. After a little search on Google, I found this Udacity SQL for Data Analysis Course and it is also free.
This course makes me a brief stretch in my understating and working with SQL. my written codes are uploaded to this repository. Thank you.
